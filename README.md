```python
============================BASICS=======================================
CREATING AND RUNNING A PROJECT
- PiPy uses python, so see python docs for more information (https://www.python.org)
- To run a project, click "File" in the top left and then click "Run" in the dropdown
- To save a project click "File" in the top left and then click "Save" or "Save As".
        If you have already saved the file, then "Save" will save it to the file you have already set.
        "Save As" will always prompt for a new file name.
UNCAPABILITYS
- PiPy does not yet support python input()
    NOTE: DO NOT PROMPT INPUT()! IT WILL GLITCH THE PROGRAM
